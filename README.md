# UFOs

## Purpose: 
The purpose of the UFO project is to allow visitors to the webpage to source UFO sightings by date of occurrence, location and attribute of the object. 

## Method: 
Using a dataset provided by the customer, the data analyst created a webpage to host the data and allow the data to be filtered by date, city, state, country or shape. The webpage was built using Javascript and HTML. 

## Results: 
The results of the project produced a webpage titled UFO Sightings that includes a filterable list of sightings. The interactive page provides the user input boxes to search for sightings specific to their search. Data can be sourced using one filter or multiple filters, allowing for refined searches. Users can use the refresh function on the webpage or the link UFO Sightings to clear their search and return to the full list of sightings.
